                <h3>Dog & Cat Boarding</h3>
                <p>Our most important asset is staff education and training. A dog’s experience while being in a new or
                    different environment can be exciting and fun but may also become stressful or even unpleasant if
                    the people caring for them are not well informed and attentive. Dogs process and respond to new
                    environments in ways that are different from humans, and it’s important to be aware of those
                    differences when caring for them. We believe that understanding how dogs demonstrate how they feel
                    and what they need and having the tools and knowledge available to make each dog as comfortable and
                    happy as possible are key to providing the best experience for your pet. </p>

                <h3> Horse Boarding</h3>
                <p>ur horse boarding packages are suited to owners who take an active role with their trained and
                    well-behaved horses. We’re limited on space and time, so we ask that our owners visit a minimum of
                    twice a week. We don’t pick hooves. We don’t groom. We’re not a fancy boarding facility. We have 12
                    acres of lush pasture and our horses are the Happiest Herd in the Heartland!
                    Packages include access to shelter, grain feedings, farrier scheduling, de-wormer and more.
                    Swingin’ D provides nutritional grain to suit each individual horse’s body type, age and activity
                    level. Our healthy horses graze throughout the day, and we offer a dry lot for easy keepers prone
                    to founder or digestive issues.! </p>

                <h3> Dog Training</h3>
                <p>In Fundamentals of Dog Behavior and Training I, Cesar Millan personally brings his exceptional
                    insights into dog behavior to a hands-on training course ideal for dog owners and trainers alike.
                    In this five-day program, you will learn the subtle yet powerful physical and psychological
                    language of canines and how to use it to build balanced relationships. You'll discover how to
                    address and resolve problem behaviors, achieve calm submission ans share these skills with friends,
                    family and clients. It's immensely practical yet filled with the values and ideas that made Cesar
                    the world's most renowned dog behaviorist. </p>

                <h3> Riding Lessons</h3>
                <p>We offer private lessons scheduled one-on-one with our riding instructor. Private lessons are $50
                    for 25 minutes of riding. When you arrive your horse will be tacked and ready to ride, but if you
                    would like to help brush and tack let us know when you schedule your appointment so we can be sure
                    to accommodate you. Private lessons are perfect if you have a specific skill you are looking to
                    work on, or if you are nervous about taking your first few lessons! </p>
