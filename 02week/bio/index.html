 <p>Predators have been visiting Earth for thousands of years. It was they who taught early human civilizations how to build pyramids, and were worshiped as gods.</p><br>
<p>Every 100 years they visited Earth to take part in a rite of passage by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Aliens, creating the "ultimate prey" for the Predators to hunt while being able to survive in the pyramid; if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Aliens and themselves.</p><br>
<p>For centuries Predators used the pyramids to initiate their hunting rituals. The heat bloom is to attract humans for the sole purpose of making new Aliens to hunt.</p>
<p> Now armed with this knowledge, you are about enter the world Predators and Serpants. Only the strong will survive. Good Luck!</p><br>
